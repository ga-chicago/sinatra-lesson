# client-side JS
  # add jQuery
  # when the button is clicked, use AJAX to hit your JSON route
  # parse the returned JSON data and display on the page

# if time, figure out a way to have a link (if you didn't do the button thing above) to each place and clicking that link will show just the data for that place
